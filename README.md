# HTTP API Utilities

This was developed for internal use when creating HTTP API servers, hopefully it's also useful to someone else.

We're welcome to external contributions if it makes our tools better for us, or for everyone else.

This isn't on crates.io, instead, to use the crate:

```toml
[dependencies.http-api-utils]
git = "https://github.com/MeVitae/rust-http-api-utils.git"
version = "0.1.1"
```

Docs can be generated using `cargo doc --open`.
